# Goal Tracker iOS App

The Goal Tracker iOS app is designed to help users track their goals and progress. With this app, users can turn each goal into a "card" that can be "stamped" to mark milestones. The app encourages users to maintain streaks, which contribute to their score, and allows them to monitor goals that may not have tangible milestones. Additionally, users can create shared cards with friends, fostering accountability and making goal attainment more satisfying.
